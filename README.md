# Dummy-Zone
It Depends how we look into the word `Stupid`, maybe for a small 10 yrs old kid jumping on a bed makes him feel like a superman , dismantling and exploreing the electronical parts, driving vehicle at high speed when grils are around XD,but for others these activites may look like a `Stupid Thing`. So our team came forward with a thought to build an app where the user can share his/her stupid moments/tasks in their life with the people around the globe. 
`Dummy-Zone` is a place to interact with new people, share crazy or cringy  challenges to make fun time more fun. It helps people to connect to with each other anonymously with direct chats to anyone anywhere in the globe.
